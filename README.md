# Titanic-Data-Analytics
The project involved analyzing the Titanic dataset to determine the factors that influenced the survival rate of children during the disaster. The analysis considered variables such as age, gender, port of embarkation, and family size (if available) to create a compelling narrative.

The analysis was conducted using a Jupyter notebook created with Python and relevant libraries, and implementing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to construct a story around the survival of children on the Titanic. Jupyter markup was used to enhance the commentary in the notebook and make it more informative.

The notebook presents a detailed analysis of the data, along with relevant visualizations. The focus was on using simple EDA techniques to effectively communicate the story through easily readable and comprehensible visualizations.
